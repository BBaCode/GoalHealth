## General Information

- This project was a mini hackathon challenge undertaken by one of my peers and I during our bootcamp at Brainstation
- We were given a little under 24 hours to build it from the ground up
- The purpose of this app is to combine both goals/tasks features with journal/reflection features to give a wholistic self-help app
- As a note, my peer (Bryan Kwok) has the original repo which is private, so this is is simply a clone of what we originally did

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React Router
- Web APIs
- Axios
- SASS

## Setup

Working towards a deployed version of this project but in the mean time feel free to install a version locally by:

    run npm i in both the client and server folders.
    run npm start in the client folder to start the front end.
    run node server.js in the server folder to start the back end.

## Usage

Meant to be a mobile app. Resize your browser (either manually or with devtools) to put the screen between 380px for best experience. Should look like the below:

## Project Status

Project is: in progress!

## Room for Improvement

Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:

- Overall design/asthetic: certainly not a designer myself, it looks fine but would use better colors/fonts possibly (will likely change)
- Fully responsive (will likely add)

To do:

- Make the app fully functional which would include:

* Any notes added in a day would be logged into the journal archvies
* Add a login/user validation
* Goals/Todos logged in storage and dont disappear when the page resets
